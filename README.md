  7. Approach was to hit the MVP then work on stretches.

  9. Installation: click on the vercel link to see the website or you can download the files from github, https://github.com/TCabz/SEIR-ZEN-PROJECT-1.git. Time to work on the project was a hinderance. Did most of the project early morning hours.
