# Project 1 Pokedex

## Resources

All previous lessons are on the class readme


## Project Details

### &#x1F534; Mandatory To Pass:
#### MVP - Minimum Viable Product

#### Your application must meet these requirements:

  1. Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery
  2. Hosted on github pages\* or [vercel](https://vercel.com)<br>
  3. Commits to github every day\*<br>
  4. A `README.md` file with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, a link to your live site, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.

\* **Note:** You will create your project on `github.com`, **NOT** `git.generalassemb.ly`.

#### The app must:

  1. Use AJAX to make a request to an external data source like OMDBapi and insert some of the data retrieved into the DOM
  1. Implement responsive design (i.e. it should be fully functional on desktop, tablet, mobile, etc)
  1. Have one or more complex user interface modules such as a carousel, drag and drop, a sticky nav, tooltips, animations, etc

### 📋 List of API's

Below is a non-exhaustive list of some free APIs you can use. There are _many_ APIs out there, however, so if you find one not on this list that you'd like to use, feel free! Please note that some may require signing up for an API key (e.g. the Marvel API).

  1. Marvel: https://developer.marvel.com/
  1. Star Wars: https://swapi.co/
  1. Weather: https://openweathermap.org/api
  1. News: https://newsapi.org/
  1. Giphy: https://developers.giphy.com/
  1. Pokemon: http://pokeapi.co/
  1. Card Deck: https://deckofcardsapi.com/
  1. Google Books: https://developers.google.com/books/
  1. City of Chicago: https://data.cityofchicago.org/
  1. Beer: https://www.brewerydb.com/developers
  1. Chuck Norris: http://www.icndb.com/
  1. Rick and Morty: https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation/#rest

Lastly, the following sites congregate a bunch of APIs together, so you can take a look through their libraries and try to find an API that interests you! Note, however, that not all APIs are free and many listed may require payment. We **highly suggest** to use a free API for your first project dealing with one.  We **also suggest** doing a "hello world" with your API as soon as possible to make sure it does what you want it to do.  **Not all APIs are created equal.**

#### More API's:

  1. https://rapidapi.com/

### &#x1F535; Stretch Goals (Not Mandatory):
#### Recommended Features

- Implement game functionality (e.g. a quiz or popping balloons with API data for points)
- Look into [localstorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) so you can save data to the user's browser

## Make A New Repo

:heavy_exclamation_mark: You will be using GitHub, **not** GitHub Enterprise!

:heavy_exclamation_mark: **Do not** begin your project within the class repo.

:heavy_exclamation_mark: **Do not** clone your project into the class repo.

1. After your project has been approved, [make a new github repo for your project](https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/). You will be deploying this project onto github pages.

Follow the instructions outlined by github themselves on [github.io](https://pages.github.com/).  You need to select `Project site` and `Start from scratch`.  If you need help, ask during office hours or class on right away.

Please note that you will be using a similar process for creating your portfolio later on.

Make sure you name your project appropriately (make it your app's name, for example `omdb-app`, and _**not**_ something like `unit-one-project`). You can then view your app online by going to your `github.io` url with `/the-repo-name` tacked on at the end!

<details><summary>Extra: want your own domain name?</summary>

You can also host your github pages with your own domain name. [Here is a walktrhough from namecheap, one web hosting service](https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/9645/2208/how-do-i-link-my-domain-to-github-pages)
</details>

## Technical Demonstration

All projects will be presented to the class.  Your presentation should:

* Be approximately 5 minutes in length
* Show off all features of the app
* Explain the technical details
* Explain the technical challenges
* Explain which improvements you might make

You will be sharing your project/game and your code.  Be prepared to answer questions from the instructors and other students.

## Meetings with instructors
_Reach out to an instructor/IA to set up a meeting time to approve your project. If you don't do this by the Saturday of project week, the instructional staff will reach out to you and decide on a time._

**By Saturday of project week - Mandatory**<br>
You will meet with an instructor for ~5 minutes to get your app idea approved. Be sure to sketch out a wireframe, pick out what API you want to use, and write out what features you will need to build in order to meet MVP and some stretch goal ideas _before_ you meet with us!

## How to Submit Your Project
Your project is due on Wednesday at 6:30 pm EST. You will present your project and show your code to classmates and instructors.


:heavy_check_mark: Add your project to the [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fS22w516hrhnCq4oJuuUdUQXpVWzxLps8brO4I0ulJc/edit?pli=1#gid=0). Note that this will be the order you present your projects!


## Where to go for help during project week
1. Seek out help online
2. Seek out help with your classmates
3. Seek out help with our class IAs


## Suggested Ways to Get Started

* **Wireframe** Make a drawing of what your app will look like in all of its stages (what does it look like as soon as you log on to the site? What does it look like once data is retrieved?).

* **Break the project down into different components** (data, presentation, views, style, DOM manipulation) and brainstorm each component individually.

* **Commit early, commit often.** Don’t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.

* **Consult documentation resources** (MDN, jQuery, etc.) at home to better understand what you’ll be getting into.

### Think about...

- **Creativity**  
Did you add a personal spin or creative element into your project submission? Did you deliver something of value to the end user?

- **Code Quality**  
Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, indentation, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

- **Problem Solving**  
Are you able to explain why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you demonstrate that you thought through alternative implementations?

## Example Project Idea

Below is a very simple project idea using OMDB and jQuery (please note, your project should include more styling and functionality):

![](https://i.imgur.com/L6hwHMR.gif)

Consider framing your project around a problem. For example, if I were to create an app similar to the one above, maybe the problem is my friends and I always have weekly movie nights and we're starting to run out of movies to watch. So, I thought about creating an app where I can search for movies and see their summaries. Or just thought about creating an app to help schedule the movie nights with what movie we'll be watching, etc.
